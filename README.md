# TeamM_BE
This is the back-end of an e-commerce website project created for EECS 4413, which focuses on building e-commerce systems.
### NOTE: The AWS server is currently offline; however, the code can be cloned and run locally.
I was responsible for developing the back-end of the website, which includes designing the database and ensuring the correct functionality of all URLs. This ensures that the front-end can effortlessly fetch the required data.
## To import project into Eclipse

I used GitHub Desktop and cloned the project to my eclipse-workspace. Then, I opened Eclipse and created a new web dynamic project with the name 'TeamM_BE,' ensuring that the name matched the cloned directory exactly.
Once I made the necessary changes, I went back to the GitHub Desktop app and pushed the changes to the origin.

It also checks the amount the user is adding and it checks that there are enough resources. Its is limited to 10.
